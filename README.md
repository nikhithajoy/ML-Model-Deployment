# ML-Model-Deployment🚀
## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to deploying machine learning models using different frameworks and tools. It provides step-by-step examples for deploying models using FastAPI, Flask, Docker, Streamlit, and other modern deployment techniques.

## Why This Repository?
Machine learning models are powerful, but without deployment, they remain inaccessible to end-users. This repository covers multiple deployment strategies so that ML practitioners can learn and choose the right method based on their needs.

## Deployment Methods Covered
✔️ FastAPI – High-performance API deployment
✔️ Flask – Lightweight and easy API-based deployment
✔️ Docker – Containerized deployments for portability
✔️ Streamlit – Interactive UI for ML models
✔️ Gradio – No-code UI for ML models
