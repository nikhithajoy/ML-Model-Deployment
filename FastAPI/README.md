# ðŸš€ FastAPI BankNote Authentication

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project demonstrates how to use **FastAPI** to build an API that authenticates banknotes as **real or fake** using a **machine learning model** trained on the BankNote Authentication dataset.  

We use **Random Forest Classifier** from `scikit-learn` for prediction and **FastAPI** for creating a simple API that serves the model. The API takes numerical inputs representing the statistical properties of banknotes and returns whether they are **"Fake"** or **"Not Fake"**.

## ðŸ”¥ What is FastAPI?  
**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python. It is based on standard Python **type hints** and offers:  
âœ… **Automatic API documentation** (Swagger UI & ReDoc)  
âœ… **Asynchronous support** (ideal for high-performance apps)  
âœ… **Fast execution** (thanks to Starlette & Pydantic)  
âœ… **Type validation** (ensures correct input format)  

FastAPI is an excellent choice for serving machine learning models as web APIs.
